# Contributing

We welcome contributions and suggestions for our DECT package! Here are some
basic guidelines for contributing:

### How to Submit an Issue

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Before submitting a new issue, please check if it
   has already been reported.

2. **Open a New Issue**: If your issue is new, open a new issue in the
   repository. Provide a clear and detailed description of the problem,
   including steps to reproduce the issue if applicable.

3. **Include Relevant Information**: Include any relevant information, such as
   system details, version numbers, and screenshots, to help us understand and
   resolve the issue more efficiently.

### How to Contribute

If you're unfamiliar with contributing to open source repositories, here is a
basic roadmap:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub
   account.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dect.git
   ```

3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.

   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes in the new branch.

5. **Commit Changes**: Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message.

   ```sh
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```

6. **Push Changes**: Push the changes to your forked repository.

   ```sh
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Submit a Pull Request**: Open a pull request to the main repository with a
   clear description of your changes and the purpose of the contribution.
